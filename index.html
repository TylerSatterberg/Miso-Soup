   <h1>The backstory of Miso Soup</h1> 
  <p> 
    It all started by going to the beach with my friend, Jack Fulbeck, 
    when i got in his dads car i met a dog whos name was Miso. When we got to the beach we went surfing, when we came in for lunch jack pulled out a tub of miso soup... 
    then i had the bright idea of telling jack he should turn miso into a soup.
